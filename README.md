This is a basic game demonstrating use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The grid is set up using the Bootstrap CDN. DOM manipulation is done with jQuery.
Game logic is done in Javascript and results in changes to the page.
The player character is displayed in the bottom left of the battle area, Enemy in the top right.
Health bars do not display numerical values, but instead shrink proportionally to the remaining percentage of health.
There are 4 character choices, which all have different attacks and health.
They also have different speeds, determining which character takes damage first.
The player character always uses an attack that increases in power over time, but they must fight three enemies one after another.
The game is balanced so that the player may win or lose with any character depending on strategy.
The page must be refreshed to play again.
